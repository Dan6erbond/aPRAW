Asynchronous Python Reddit API Wrapper by [Dan6erbond](https://dan6erbond.github.io)

**aPRAW** is an asynchronous API wrapper written for the Reddit API that builds on the idea of [PRAW](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw) in many ways. It follows a very similar design, but adds features such as unlimited listings and, most importantly, support for asynchronous requests. This allows the library to be used in scenarios where the requests can take longer (such as with those unlimited listings and streams) and not block other tasks.

## Key Features

 - Asynchronous HTTPS requests to the Reddit API.
 - Unlimited listings.
 - Full OOP class design.

## Installation

aPRAW requires a release of Python 3.6 or newer as it uses the inbuilt `async` and `await` syntax. You can install PRAW via pip:

```pip install apraw```

## Quickstart

Create an application on your Reddit account as per their [documentation](https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/OAuth2-Quick-Start-Example). Once you have that, you can interact with aPRAW and its subclasses:

```python
import apraw
import asyncio


# instantiate a `Reddit` instance
# you can also supply a key to an entry within a praw.ini
# file, making your login compatible with praw as well
reddit = apraw.Reddit(client_id="CLIENT_ID", client_secret="CLIENT_SECRET",
                    password="PASSWORD", user_agent="USERAGENT",
                    username="USERNAME")

async def scan_posts():
  # get an instance of a subreddit
  subreddit = await reddit.subreddit("aprawtest")

  # loop through new posts
  async for submission in subreddit.new():
    print(submission.title)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # get the asyncio event loop
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

    # add scan_posts() to the queue and run it
    loop.run_until_complete(scan_posts())
```

Due to the fact that aPRAW's code is almost entirely asynchronous, you will have to perform all network-related tasks within the asyncio event loop.
