Introduction
============

aPRAW serves as an asynchronous alternative to PRAW, and offers certain features and a more modern class design. Those familiar with PRAW will be able to use many features without much additional changes to the code, besides the usage of :code:`async` and :code:`await` syntax.

aPRAW was specifically built with Discord bots in mind, so those interested in creating a Discord bot with Discord.py and combining Reddit streams should be able to make use of its asynchronous functionalities.

Prerequisites
-------------

aPRAW works with Python 3.6 or higher.

Installing
----------

aPRAW can be installed directly from PyPi:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ pip install aPRAW
